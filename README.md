# JSONPlaceholder API Tests

This project demonstrates how to use Postman for testing the JSONPlaceholder API. It includes:
- GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API requests.
- Automated tests using Postman scripts.
- Environment variables for flexibility.

## How to Use
1. Import the collection into Postman.
2. Set up the environment with your base URL (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`).
3. Run the collection to test the different API methods.
